User Manual:

This is pretty much the same as official checkers, with some minor differences to make it more fun.

Layout:
- Checkers is a two player game where white goes first.
- To start, press “new game.”
- If you want to quit, click “end game.”
	- Click “new game” afterwards if you want to play again.
- The interface between the computer and the user is located at the bottom of the board.
	- It will print out messages notifying the user whose turn it is, whether a user has selected a legal piece to move, announce the winner, etc.
- Pieces you can move will be highlighted in blue.
- After you click on a piece the possible moves for that piece will be outlined in blue.

Movement:
- Each pawn can only move in the direction its color faces.
- Once a pawn reaches the other side, it becomes a king (which is indicated by a crown) and then can move any direction diagonally.
- Even if it is possible to jump a piece, the player does not have to jump it; the player has free movement, meaning it can move another piece if any other pieces still remain.
- If only one piece remains, it must be moved every turn.
- After you jump a piece, if you are able to jump again you have to.
- Even if a player has pieces remaining, if they cannot legally move any of those pieces they lose.
